# Human-Detection-And-Counting
This is a image processing project using Open-CV library to detect and count humans from a video, camera or images

## Summary:
This is a computer vision approach to detect humans and get the count so that it can be used in various monitoring applications. Here I am using HOG or Histogram Oriented Gradient Descriptor, which is a feature descriptor used for object detection. OpenCV combined the HOG algorithm along with Support Vector Machine for effective feature extraction and classification of objects. The in-built people detector functionality is used here to detect the humans and a counter variable to get the number of humans in a picture or a video. 

## Libraries Needed:
* OpenCV - machine learning and image processing
* Numpy - scientific computing
* Imutils - image processing

## Installation:
* pip install opencv-python
